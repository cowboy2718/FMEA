# IRRCalc
Incident Rate Ratio Calculator
Tony Gojanovic


## Background

This simple calcultor computes the ratio of two incident rates (r1/r2) along with a 95% confidence interals.  Specifically, calculating the following quantities:

IRR = (cases_post_intervention/time_post_intervention) / (cases_pre_intervention/time_pre_intervention)

CI = exp(ln(IRR) +/- 1.96*sqrt(1/cases_pre_intervention + 1/cases_post_intervention))

So, IRR is Incident Rate Ratio and in the abouve, caes pre and post are measured in "person years" but other types of standardizing factors may be used as well.
